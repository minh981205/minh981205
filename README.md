- 👋 Hi, I’m Minh Nguyen
- 👀 I’m interested in IoT projects which are used in everyday life. I'm working on creating an automated plant watering system, which can also be manually controlled remotely.
- 🌱 I’m always actively trying to learn new skills. Currently learning web development with HTML, JavaScript, CSS with frameworks to create a web interface for my plant watering system.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects IoT related, or web developing to improve my overall skills.
- :plate_with_cutlery: Feel free to checkout my repository to see the project I'm working on right now
